# KinaHub (formerly Dukan) 🛍️

KinaHub is a modern, local-first e-commerce and CRM platform designed to bridge the gap between local seller stores and customers. Built as an On-the-Job Training (OJT) project, it supports multi-seller storefronts, localized delivery estimations, full customer relations dashboards, and client-side AI integration to guide customer shopping decisions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Django (Python), Django REST Framework
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
*   **Database:** SQLite3
*   **AI Engine:** OpenRouter API (client-side LLM inference)

## ⚙️ How It Works

KinaHub operates on a decoupled client-server architecture:
1.  **Django Backend API:** Handles all user authentication (JWT-based), relational data (products, stores, orders, cart details), and seeding utilities.
2.  **React Frontend:** Standard SPA powered by Vite. Communicates with Django endpoints using Axios/fetch.
3.  **AI Orchestration:**
    *   When browsing, rule-based algorithms generate insights locally (e.g., analyzing cart totals and seller concentrations).
    *   For conversational shopping, the assistant utilizes a failover list of free LLM models on OpenRouter, authenticating client-side using a configured API key.

## 🏃 Getting Started

We have provided convenient scripts to launch the entire project concurrently:

### On Linux / macOS
Make the script executable (if not already) and run it:
```bash
./start.sh
```

### On Windows
Double-click the batch file:
```cmd
start.bat
```

*These scripts automatically launch the Django API server, perform npm installations, boot up the Vite dev server, and open `http://localhost:5173` in your default browser.*
